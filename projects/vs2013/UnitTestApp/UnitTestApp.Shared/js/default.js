    // @TODO: figure out how to tell files are edited so that we can only list tests that depend on them
    //  - note that this will likely need to be smart and take into account the directory in 
    //    which private modules live b/c we won't want the actual dependency walk or else editing
    //    promises means you have to test the world

    // @TODO: add a nice UI with flyouts and ListViews and such to select which tests to run

    // @TODO: the actual tests being run however are just a QUnit page in a x-ms-webview, right?
